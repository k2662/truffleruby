yarp_specific: true # an AssignRescueVariableNode node is introduced
notes: >
  An instance variable capturing is represented with the following simplified AST:
  
    (WriteInstanceVariableNode name = @error
      (ReadFrameSlotNodeGen)
      (ReadGlobalVariableNodeGen name = $!
        (LookupGlobalVariableStorageNodeGen name = $!)))
  
  that is equivalent to:
  
  ```ruby
  @error = $!
  ```
